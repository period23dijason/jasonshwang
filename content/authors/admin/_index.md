My name is Jason and I am a Taiwanese Canadian born and mostly raised in Vancouver, BC. Growing up, I have been interested in making websites, and have started programming since Grade 11. In 2020, I graduated from Simon Fraser University with a bachelor's degree in Computing Science under the Co-operative Education degree designation. I have over two years of co-op and work experience under my belt, including around a year of internship and co-op at a tech startup, an international medical company, and the International CyberCrime Research Centre at the School of Criminology.

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant under Professor Richard Frank at the School of 
Criminology at the ICCRC. With our main Dark Crawler website, I have developed processes via Python 
and MySQL to facilitate the training of machine learning models that use scraped data off the Dark Web and other social media platforms to predict potentially criminal or fake information for clients such as the RCMP.
